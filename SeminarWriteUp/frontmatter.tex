%% Abstract
\begin{abstract}
  In July 2012 the two experiments CMS~\cite{CMSHiggsDiscovery} and ATLAS~\cite{ATLASHiggsDiscovery} observed a new particle, namely the Higgs boson.
  The discovery in the decay channels $\PH \rightarrow \PZ \PZ$ and $\PH \rightarrow \Pgamma \Pgamma$ marks a keystone
  in particle physics. The last missing piece of the Standart Model of particle physics was found and validates the existence of
  the so-called Higgs field predicted by Peter Higgs in 1964~\cite{Higgs1_higgsMechanism,Higgs2_higgsMechanism}.
  This write up describes the fundamental principles of Higgs physics and the discovery of the consequently predicted Higgs boson.
  Special insight is given into the $\PH \rightarrow \PZ \PZ \rightarrow 4\Plepton$ analysis, the famous "golden channel", which provides the highest
  precision for measuring the mass of the Higgs boson.
